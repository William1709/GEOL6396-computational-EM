# Introduction
This repository is created for the course - GEOL6396 Computational EM in University of Houston.
The language of the repository is python 100%.

Brief introductions of the repository are summarized below:

**code** 
 - All scripts for 4 different labs in the course.
 
 - "geometry.py": a package has 3 Classes: Mesh, Discretize and Utils. Here we want to mention that this package has a high degree of compatibility, which can be flexibly applied to many other geophysical forward and inversion problems outside the course. The plethora of notations have already been added in the script to explain the use and meaning of each function.
 
 - "tools.py": a package to deal with basic matrix calculation used for the "geometry.py".
 
 **data** 
 - The true model for the Lab3.
 
 **tests** 
 - I tested all the scripts.
 
 - The generated figs are saved in this folder providing the results that can be used for comparision for participators.
